Bank Reporting System 🏦
Overview 🌟

The Bank Reporting System is a Django-based web application designed to manage and report on various operational aspects of a banking institution. This system allows for detailed tracking of departments, sub-departments, and their respective performance metrics.
Key Features 🛠️

    User Management: Secure handling of user data with custom user models.
    Department Hierarchy: Structured representation of organizational units including Departments, SubDepartments, and Sections.
    Performance Tracking: Dynamic calculation of achieved percentages for departments and sub-departments based on various criteria.

How to Use 📚

    Setting Up:
        Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory.
        Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.

    Starting the Application:
        Run docker-compose up to build and start the containers.
        Access the application through http://localhost or the configured domain.

    Navigating the Application:
        Log in to the admin panel to manage users, departments, and other entities.
        Use the Django admin interface to add or modify entities as needed.

Function Analysis: update_achieved_percentage 🔍
Purpose

The update_achieved_percentage function plays a crucial role in the Bank Reporting System. It dynamically calculates the performance percentage of departments and sub-departments based on various underlying criteria.
How it Works

    Calculation Logic:
        The function aggregates the performance metrics (e.g., achieved percentages) of child entities (like sections in a sub-department).
        It then computes an average or weighted average based on these aggregated values.

    Propagation:
        Changes in lower hierarchy levels (like Sections) trigger updates in higher levels (like SubDepartments and Departments), ensuring that the performance metrics are always up-to-date.

Example

python

def update_achieved_percentage(self):
    # Code to aggregate and calculate percentages...
    self.save(update_fields=['achieved_percentage'])

Conclusion 🎉

The Bank Reporting System is a comprehensive tool designed for efficiency and ease of management in banking operations. Its intuitive design and robust backend make it an indispensable asset for modern banking institutions.
